I currently work as a software developer at [Redfin](http://www.redfin.com) on the Data Engineering team where we focus on building fast, scalable infrastructure to ingest nation-wide real-estate data.

Other things I've worked on in the past:
* [MEDInternational](http://www.medinternational-us.org): a non-profit startup focused on providing robust inventory management service for healthcare institutions in developing countries. Customers included a major hospital in Zanziber but we later decided to open-source our code instead.

* [Brown UPOD Group](http://www.upod.io): a small but growing research group under Prof.Littman and Blase Ur (of CMU fame) that focused on investigating, developing and testing home automation tool and user experiences. Relatively young but the group has published papers at 2 CHI conferences.
