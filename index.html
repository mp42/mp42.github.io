<h1> About me </h1>
<p> 
I currently work as a software developer at Redfin on the Data Engineering team where we focus on
building fast, scalable infrastructure to ingest nation-wide real estate data.
</p>
<p>
Other things that I have worked on:
<ul>
<li> MEDInternational - a non-profit startup focused on providing a robust inventory management service
for healthcare institutions in developing countries. Customers included a major hospital in Zanzibar but 
we decided to open-source our code instead </li>
<li> Brown UPOD group - a small but growing research group under Prof. Littman and Blase Ur (of CMU fame) 
that focused on investigating,developing and testing home automation tools and user experiences. Relatively young 
but we managed to get 2 papers to the annual CHI conference!</li>
</ul>
